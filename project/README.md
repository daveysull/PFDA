PWC Call Centra Data Analysis

Objective 
Analyze call centre data to improve performance and customer satisfaction.

Dataset 
The original dataset contained 10 columns and 5,000 rows. The dates within the dataset ranged from January 1st to March 31st 2021. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, added to a database I created in MySQL and then was connected to via Python.

1. Introduction : 

This notebook contains my analysis of PWC contact centre data. The original dataset contained 10 columns and 5,000 rows. The dates within the dataset ranged from January 1st to March 31st 2021. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, added to a database I created in MySQL and then was connected to via Python.

2. Data Preperation :

The first step of preperation was creating a database to store the data. This was done through a combination of bash scripts and MySQL queries. Once this was done I took the usual steps of setting the index, creating/dropping columns, dealing with null values, etc.

3. EDA :

This part of the notebook is where I explore the data, looking for potential trends through the creation of visuals. TBD....

4. KPI Analysis :
Operational Efficiency - Average Call Duration
Customer Satisfaction - Satisfaction Rating & Resolved Vs Unresolved
Agent Performance - Resolution Rate, Satisfaction Rate & Call Volume Handled

5. Advanced Plots - Interactive Visuals

6. Insights and Recommendations

Left to do
- Sections 3-6
- Add libraries used to introduction
